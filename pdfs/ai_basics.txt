## What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans.

## History of AI
- 1950: Alan Turing proposes the Turing Test
- 1956: The term "Artificial Intelligence" is coined at Dartmouth Conference
- 1960s-1970s: Early AI programs and expert systems
- 1980s-1990s: Machine learning renaissance
- 2000s-2010s: Big data and deep learning revolution
- 2020s: Large language models and generative AI

## Types of AI
1. **Narrow AI**: Designed for specific tasks (like chess, image recognition)
2. **General AI**: Hypothetical AI with human-level intelligence across all domains
3. **Super AI**: AI that surpasses human intelligence

## Current AI Applications
- Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant)
- Image and speech recognition
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis
- Financial fraud detection
- Content recommendation
- Language translation

## AI Ethics and Considerations
- Bias in AI systems
- Privacy concerns
- Job displacement
- Transparency and explainability
- Safety and security

The field of AI continues to evolve rapidly, with new breakthroughs happening regularly.
