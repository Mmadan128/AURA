## Machine Learning Concepts
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

### Types of Machine Learning:
1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled examples
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction and feedback

### Common Applications:
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Recommendation Systems
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Medical Diagnosis

This document serves as a test case for AURA's document processing capabilities.
